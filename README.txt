Greetings PO Grader.

Ive written the bucketizer in javascript and included the js file with
the actual code so it can be used in a browser console/another 
location you have to run js code

ive also included a crude html page that uses the bucketizer code but
has a bad interface of prompt boxes please let me know if i need to improve it
